I agree with Bridle with his list of problems and solutions. I believe content creators have their own way of making videos that will capture the attention of a mass audience. They do this to get into the YouTube algorithm and generate some income. However, some of the videos pollute and attacks children in different ways. For example, some content creators ask their audience about things they are interested in and they provide for them. While YouTube can be used for educational purposes, there are some ways which it can harm teenagers also.

In addition, I like Bridle's solution. YouTube have an analytics which shows the kind of audience that watch a specific channel or content. For example, the analytics shows the gender, country, and age of people that consume videos on the Platform. Some content creators are aware of these information and they make changes to the content they upload on YouTube.
