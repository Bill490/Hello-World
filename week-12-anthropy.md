Accessibility and coding are helpful skills that can enhance our brain and allow individuals to operate and flexible. Personally, I am a gamer, and I am interested in tweaking some aspect of my games through coding to have a high quality performance.

I usually play games on my laptop, but some of the games run slow so I look for certain adjustments which can improve performance for a smooth gameplay.

I believe it will be helpful if a number of people come together with different ideas, skills, and techniques to achieve a common goal about a game. The response from each person will highly improve the quality of a game product.
