This  is a thumbnail of a  YouTube channel for Donald Trump. The content have two captions which are set to  aim at Joe Biden. The written captions are formed as one linguistic message to draw some attention.

 Another message is the images used in the thumbnail, such as the arrow which is pointed at Joe Biden as the main culprit.  

 Last but not the least, the actual people involved are both candidates from opposition parties. They are both battling out to acquire a presidency position. Without the captions, one can assume there is some tension between the two personalities.
