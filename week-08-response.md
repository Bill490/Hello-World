I think the ads are helpful; they inform the user about other products they might be interested in. However, some of the ads show explicit content which are not meant for every individual. In addition, they website is overwhelmed with different types of ads which pops up every second when using the internet. Personally, I have an ad blocker on my system which prevents multiple showing of ads I am not interested in.

I am more interested in seeing a content about music, electronics, and games. For example, I get ads about music production because most of my YouTube subscription is about music production and selling beats. When I did not have an ad blocker on my laptop, I use to see clothing and fashion ads for females. the ad changes every second by showing content that I am not interested in. It also depends on the type of platform or website a user is on.
