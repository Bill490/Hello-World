 #Gesamtkunstwerk
Unlike the old days, nowadays, there are a lot of contemporary art pieces which are created with modern tools and materials.
For example, there are a variety of  invented, which allows users to create their own website and add whatever content they want to share.
In addition, the software that we use for this class can be classified as a **Gesamtkunstwerk**,
because it allows students to learn and apply different styles and techniques to complete a specific task.

Through personal experience, I have seen a musical piece which was created by using a software which required skills in coding. In fact, the advancement of technology has enhanced
our knowledge and the pace we work. Further, GitHub is an example of a contemporary tool which can be used for a  lot task, such as coding, editing, styling, and creating websites.
